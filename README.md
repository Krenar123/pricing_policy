## Contribution

**Refactoring code**, e.g. improving the code without modifying the behavior is an area that can probably be done based on intuition and may not require much communication to be merged.

**Fixing bugs** may also not require a lot of communication, but the more the better. Please surround bug fixes with ample tests. Bugs are magnets for other bugs. Write tests near bugs!

1.  Fork the project & clone locally.
2.  Create a branch, naming it contribute: git checkout -b contribute
3.  Push to the branch: git push origin contribute
4.  Create a pull request for your branch ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started

### Setup

#### Requirements

Install these software at first


*  Ruby (recommended version => '2.6.6') - we recommend to use rbenv for installation
*  Rails (recommended version '6.0.3' must be in '>= 6.0.3.2')
*  PostgreSQL v => 10.12 or higher
*  Bundler v => 2.1.4 or higher

#### Installation

Once you clone this project from github or download it, make sure you run `update bundler` also after that `bundle install` to make sure every gem is successfully installed and ready to use.

### Starting the application

First thing you have to do is:
`rails db:create rails db:migrate & rails db:seed` . 
Or you can use `rails db:create` and than use `rails db:reset`

Before that if you have problem connecting with database you might use `sudo service postgresql start` - for Ubuntu

Before running the server i recommend you tu run:
    `rails routes` -> to see every possible route that you want to request.

After that you can start by typing in terminal:
    `rails server` -> to run the server ( check 'localhost:3000/routes')

- You might need to run `yarn install --check-files` if Yarn packages are out of date!


### Running tests

For testing i have user RSpec framework version `4.0.1`

To run all tests run:
`$ rspec` 

#### Nesseccary gems used for testing


*   gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 4.0.1'
*   gem 'factory_bot_rails' -> for creating factories ( model testing )
*   gem 'shoulda-matchers', '~> 4.0'

#### Other gems ( libraries ) that I used :
